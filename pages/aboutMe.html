            Ah the command that will get you instantly found out on any red team engagement. I am Sascha Walker. I love learning about malware and general cybersecurity topics. During my undergrad I took part in one of the On-Campus Labs called VERONA where I could perform some malware analysis when I was not writing code for SHAREM. SHAREM was a shellcode analysis software where it would emulate and perform analysis. I was mainly responsible for creating the detection system, along with creating what I like to call a sudo-filesystem. I loved creating that filesystem, as it was the first time I ever did something like that. It would dynamically create the system as the malware demanded folders and files.

             I also got two certificates in 2024, CompTIA's Security+ and PenTest+. I challenged myself in 2023 to get a certificate by the end of the year, but with a car accident happening during the end of 2023, I had to push back both exams into 2024. I sucessfully passed by Security+ exam in Febuary (link to the verification?), and my PenTest+ in July (link to verification?) of 2024.

            Enjoy Cyber Security, I sure do! Hello there, I am Sascha Walker, I graduated with a Bachelors and my major was Cyber Operations, with a minor in Digital Forensics. I also achieved certification in CompTIA's Security+ and Pentest+. I will be talking about my journey in cyber security, and sometimes any other miscellaneous topics that I think deserve interest.
